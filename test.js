/*

Main function bugs


6 - on urls/[shortUrl] - logged in user now gets an error if they visit a page
for a shortUrl they didn't make

7 - u/[shortUrl] should redirect to the full url if this shortUrl exists

8 - check if login sets a cookie?

9 - check if register sets a cookie.

10 - register or login with existing user creates a new user ID instance in database





Extras

Clean up code

Correct variable declaration and semi-colon use

Proper and consistent indentation and spacing

Clear and consistent function and variable names

Modular and reusable code (no need to break your code into Node modules,
 but using helper functions to keep the code DRY is a good idea)

Well-commented code (in other words, that your code is easy to read)

That no debugging, commented-out or dead/un-used code is present

Sensible structure for the project's files and directories
